# Billing Amount Automation Bot

This Python automation script uses **Selenium** and **openpyxl** to log into a web application, extract monthly billing amounts for customer accounts, and write the data to Excel. It mimics user behavior to navigate through multiple pages, interact with complex UI elements, and summarize invoice amounts per month.

## Project Purpose

Before automation, manually checking and extracting invoice data for hundreds of customer accounts (each with multiple dials) was a time-consuming process. The script now:
- **Logs in automatically**
- **Searches for each account**
- **Navigates through the billing and financial pages**
- **Extracts and summarizes invoice amounts**
- **Writes the results into structured Excel files**

This has saved over **95% of the manual task time**.
